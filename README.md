What are anagrams?

Anagrams are words formed by rearranging the letters of a different word.

For example "silent" and "listen" or "binary" and "brainy" are anagram pairs.



Description

C# which is able to search in attached file (words.txt) and find the largest set of words (maximum number of occurrences) contained inside that are anagrams of each other.



Example

If "words.txt" was containing following words:

binary

please

asleep

brainy

sapele



"binary" and "brainy" are anagrams (2 occurrences)

"please", "asleep" and "sapele" are anagrams (3 occurrences) -> It should return this list


On top of finding the largest set of anagrams, please write methods to find:

- A count of words for each letter prefixed with that character from A-Z.

- Find the word with the largest number of distinct characters.
